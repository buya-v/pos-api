# POS-API

Project Name: POS-API

Project Summary
POS-API is a fiscal management solution designed to generate, register, and synchronize Value Added Tax (VAT) receipts directly with the central tax authority's database. This system serves as a compliant bridge between a business's sales operations and government requirements, ensuring that every transaction issues a valid lottery code and QR receipt in real-time.

Key Features
- Real-time generation of unique fiscal QR codes and lottery numbers for valid tax compliance.
- A robust RESTful API allowing seamless integration with existing ERP systems, online stores, or third-party POS hardware.
- A web-based administrative dashboard for manual receipt entry, voiding erroneous transactions, and viewing sales history.
- Offline synchronization capabilities to queue transactions during internet outages and process them once connectivity is restored.

Target Users
Small to medium-sized retail business owners, cashiers requiring manual entry tools, and software developers integrating fiscal reporting into custom applications.

Core User Flows
1. Automated API Request: An external POS system sends a transaction request containing items and prices; POS-API validates the data, registers it with the tax authority, and returns the printable receipt data and QR image.
2. Manual Entry: A user logs into the web portal, inputs the total transaction amount, and clicks "Generate" to print a receipt via a connected thermal printer.
3. Reporting: An administrator accesses the dashboard to export daily sales reports and verify VAT submission status.
