# POS-API - Lessons Learned

## Iteration 3

## Insights & Optimizations

### 1. Optimization: Implement global exception handling middleware to capture and log full stack traces and inner exception details, replacing the generic "Unknown issue" fallback with standardized HTTP error responses and unique correlation IDs to ensure root cause observability.

### 2. Optimization: Implement a centralized global error handling middleware that intercepts unhandled exceptions and promise rejections, logging full stack traces to the system output and returning structured, descriptive JSON error responses instead of generic 500 status codes.

### 3. Loop Analysis: The same error "Unknown issue

Test Results:
Unit Tests: 0/0 failed
UI Tests: 1 failed
Failed UI..." has occurred 3 times. Previous optimization strategies are not addressing the root cause.
